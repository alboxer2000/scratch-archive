Happy April Fool's Day!

Whether it's funny typo, a silly error, or a bug while coding a project, mistakes happen all the time. In this Scratch Design Studio, we invite you to embrace the silly everyday mistakes that we tend to make and create a project about it. Let’s laugh, learn, and turn our mistakes it into something awesome!

Looking for ideas to get started?

- Create a memory game where scratchers need to guess the right pair of cards but the pair are slightly different from each other
- Create an animation where you imagine yourself to be in the World of Mistakes and what silly adventures it might take you on
- With the help of music extensions, code a game where pressing the piano keys plays random or unexpected sounds like meow, squeak, explosion, etc
- Design a platform game in such a way that encourages Scratchers to solve glitches to complete the levels
- Make an art piece which encourages Scratchers to spot the errors in the art and share it in form of a remix

Remember, these are just suggestions! You are more than welcome to take inspiration from a project already inside the studio, or come up with an idea of your own!
