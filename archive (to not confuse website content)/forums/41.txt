Just a heads up that we're planning on doing a database migration again this weekend, so the projects / etc. on the alpha will be updated based on a snapshot of the current Scratch website from today or tomorrow.

Then next week we'll be inviting a bunch of new testers - people who've curated, SDS curators, TBG mods, and Collab Counselors.
